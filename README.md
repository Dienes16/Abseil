# Abseil

A simple vanilla-friendly climbing rope mod for Minecraft Fabric.


## Usage

- Craft rope using two leads and a slime ball
- Place a standard tripwire hook and attach the rope to it
- Ropes can be climbed like any other climbable
- One rope item produces a rope of any length downwards
- Rope can be broken at any point to shorten it
- Additional ropes can be tied to the ends of existing ropes to make them longer


## Other Features

- Rope recipe auto-unlocks in recipe book
- Ropes are flammable and waterloggable
- Tripwire hooks with a rope attached emit a redstone signal


## Known Issues

- Vanilla Minecraft logic that checks for tripwires can cause the rope to pop off the tripwire hook, e.g. when placing a tripwire hook of the opposite side


## Compatibility

- Should be compatible with any mods
- No dependencies
- Note that the rope design matches with the vanilla tripwire hook appearance, so any resource packs changing the tripwire hook may cause the rope to be in a weird visual position
